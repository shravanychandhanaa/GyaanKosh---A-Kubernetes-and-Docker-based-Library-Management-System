</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: E-Learning Platform</h3>
<p>
  Developed a full-stack E-learning application featuring a responsive UI and a MongoDB/Express data layer. Managed the end-to-end deployment process on AWS EC2, including server configuration and environment optimization to support high-availability and seamless performance.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<!-- Project 2 -->
<h3 id="project2">Project 2: Library Mangement System</h3>
<p>
  This project is a containerized Library Management System deployed on a Minikube cluster, featuring a Node.js backend and a MongoDB database with Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for reliable data storage. By using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, the system ensures a self-healing, scalable environment for managing book requests and administrative approvals. This setup demonstrates a modern DevOps workflow, moving from local development to a cloud-native deployment.

The yoga and mindfulness practices improved my self-discipline and stress management, while community engagement with elderly citizens strengthened my empathy and social responsibility. Overall, these sessions supported my personal growth, career readiness, and balanced lifestyle.
