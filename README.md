## Overall Learning 

> _Leveraged AWS (EC2, S3, ELB) and Kubernetes to architect and manage scalable cloud infrastructure. Streamlined software delivery by engineering CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, while ensuring system reliability through proactive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana._

<p><strong><a href="#project2">Project 2:</a></strong> Library Management System</p>

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: E-Learning Platform</h3>
<p>
  Developed a full-stack E-learning application featuring a responsive UI and a MongoDB/Express data layer. Managed the end-to-end deployment process on AWS EC2, including server configuration and environment optimization to support high-availability and seamless performance.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<!-- Project 2 -->
<h3 id="project2">Project 2: Library Mangement System</h3>
<p>
  This project is a containerized Library Management System deployed on a Minikube cluster, featuring a Node.js backend and a MongoDB database with Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for reliable data storage. By using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, the system ensures a self-healing, scalable environment for managing book requests and administrative approvals. This setup demonstrates a modern DevOps workflow, moving from local development to a cloud-native deployment.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
> The LST and SST sessions at Skill India Institute helped me grow personally, professionally, and socially. Through life skills, yoga, and job-search sessions, I learned self-discipline, stress management, communication, and career preparedness. The social service activities such as tree plantation and helping elderly people made me more responsible, empathetic, and socially aware. Overall, these sessions helped me build confidence, maintain a balanced lifestyle, and understand the importance of contributing positively to society.
